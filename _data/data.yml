            - **Supervisor**: [Prof. Nobuaki Minematsu](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/people/people000413.html)
            - **Research Interest and Focus**: Speech technologies in Computer-aided language learning (CALL)
            - **Master thesis**: Sequential annotation and prediction of L2 speech instantaneous intelligibility based on shadowing techniques
            - **Summary**:
                - **Background**: Speech intelligibility assessment is essential for Second Language (L2) learners. However, intelligibility prediction has not been well-developed due to difficulties in measuring while-listening behaviors of listeners.
                - **Proposal**: This study proposes an instantaneous annotation of L2 speech intelligibility with multiple levels of granularity, 
                including frame, phoneme, syllable, and word. 
                Subsequently, we constructed an intelligibility prediction model using the collected annotations to enable automatic assessment of instantaneous intelligibility.
            - **Publications**: 4 international and 5 domestic Japanese conferences papers (See section below).
            - **Award**: [Outstanding Presentation Award of the Annual Meeting of Phonetic Society of Japan](https://www.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/topics/foee/topics/setnws_202104121405215963284986.html)
